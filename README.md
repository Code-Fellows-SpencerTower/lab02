# lab02

This is a project all for the user experience, and getting to know me, the coder behind it.

I first started with bio for the basic information about myself.

Then there's a list that, once the user answers questions, will populate with the correct answers. At the end of the list, there is a counter that will add up the amount of answers the user got right, and update based on that counter.
