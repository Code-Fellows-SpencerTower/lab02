        <p id = "bio">My name is Daniel Jackson, and I am learning Software Development at Code Fellows. I have an Associates Degree in Arabic, and have also taken various computer courses pertaining to network architecture and security, however, Code Fellows is my first step into Software Development of any kind. My previous job was in the military, where I worked as an Arabic Linguist for 5 years. A long term goal of mine is to get good at coding and make a career out of it, and be able to work on side projects as well. I've been seriously enjoying creative coding, which is making visuals using javascript, so I hope to get better at that as well.</p>
